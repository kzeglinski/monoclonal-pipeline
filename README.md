# yet to be named monoclonal pipeline
for processing plate-based nanopore sequencing data (as a replacement for sanger)

[WIP]

potential future additions:
- basecalling (only if genomics cbf doing it themselves)
- nanobody mode (only if new nano data coming)
- matchbox for annotation
- qc for sequencing + miniprep
